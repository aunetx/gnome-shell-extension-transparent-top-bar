# GNOME Shell Extension - Smart transparent topbar

A GNOME Shell extension that allows customizing the topbar when free-floating.

This extension now supports changing:

- topbar background color / opacity
- topbar text color / opacity
- transition duration
- transition distance

Between free-floating and non free-floating states :)
