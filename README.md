# GNOME Shell Extension - Fully Transparent Top Bar

A GNOME Shell extension that brings back the transparent top bar when free-floating in GNOME Shell.

Based on zhanghai [https://github.com/zhanghai/gnome-shell-extension-transparent-top-bar](work), but this time with transparency set to 100%. (by the way, thanks to him!)
